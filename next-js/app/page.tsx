            Crew Kudos is a recognition platform built for real teams. Itâ€™s
            designed to spotlight effort, reinforce positive behaviors, and
            build a culture of appreciation â€” one shoutout at a time. Whether
            youâ€™re a lifeguard, camp counselor, or youth leader, Crew Kudos
            helps your team stay connected through genuine recognition.
            <br /> <br />
            Every kudos is instantly delivered to the recipient by email or
            text, making sure great work never goes unnoticed â€” and is
            celebrated in the moment it matters most.

            Why we built it?
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Weâ€™ve trained hundreds of staff and saw one thing consistently:
            teams thrive when they are appreciated. But too often, recognition
            gets lost in the shuffle. Crew Kudos makes lifting up others simple,
            meaningful, and part of every day.
