            Why we built it?

          <span className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed flex flex-col space-y-2">
            <p>
              We built Crew Kudos because the best teams don‚Äôt just run on rules
              ‚Äî they run on recognition.
            </p>
            <p>
              Too often, the hard work, initiative, and character that keep
              things moving go unnoticed. We saw it in lifeguard teams, youth
              programs, and frontline roles: people showing up, giving their
              best, and rarely hearing ‚Äúyou made a difference.‚Äù
            </p>
            <p>
              We knew there had to be a better way to reinforce what matters ‚Äî
              not through points or gimmicks, but through real, human
              appreciation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Crew Kudos is a system built for culture. It‚Äôs simple, fast, and
              designed to fit into the rhythm of real work ‚Äî not disrupt it.
